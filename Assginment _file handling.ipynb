    "\n",
    "Python has a built-in garbage collector (GC) that automatically frees memory by deleting objects that are no longer in use.\n",

    "It mainly uses two techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object in Python keeps track of how many references point to it.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a reference is deleted or goes out of scope, the count decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reference count becomes zero, the memory is freed immediately.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "2. Cyclic Garbage Collection\n",

    "## 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Python has automatic memory management, there are still some challenges developers should be aware of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Memory Leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "Python automatically frees unused objects via garbage collection, but circular references (objects referring to each other) can sometimes cause memory to not be released immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class A:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        \n",

    "a2 = A()\n",
    "\n",
    "a1.ref = a2\n",
    "\n",
    "a2.ref = a1  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Garbage collector eventually handles this, but it can lead to temporary memory leaks if not careful.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing large amounts of data (like big lists, dictionaries, or datasets) can consume a lot of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers need to optimize data structures or use generators to reduce memory footprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inefficient Object Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Python relies on reference counting, but some objects may linger longer than needed, especially in complex programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly deleting objects (del) or using gc.collect() may be needed in rare cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Managing Resources Beyond Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management also includes external resources like file handles, network connections, or database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "If not handled properly, these can leak resources, even if memory is freed.\n",
